Landing page for GM Photos

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
You can run directly the landing.html page in the "dist" folder, which was provided for demo purposes or follow the Installing instructions.

### Installing

Please download the zip file with sources into a folder, extract the files and run the following command from the terminal:

```
npm install
```

and

```
npm run build
```

that should create two additional folders "node_modules" and "dist" in the source folder

## Running the landing page

Run the landing.html page in the "dist" folder either manually or with a live web server (ex. Go Live)
